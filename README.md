# Foobar

Foobar is a social networking application similar to Facebook, designed to connect people and support sharing of updates and photos.

## Features

- **Sign Up and Login:** Foobar allows users to create accounts securely with a unique username and password. Users can then log in to access their account and use the app's features.

- **Feed:** The heart of Foobar is its feed, where the user can see updates, posts, and media.

- it is important to say that at this current version we only support profile picture of certain size (60KB) and format (jpg). We are attaching an example of profile picture that is under these conditions and works.

2. Access Foobar in your browser at `http://ip:port`.


## Work Process

Our development process follows these steps:

1. **Planning:** We start with brainstorming and defining the features and functionalities of Foobar and then we put it onto Jira.
2. **Design:** Once the requirements are clear, we move to the design phase.
3. **Implementation:** With the designs in hand, we proceed to implement the frontend components of Foobar, ensuring they meet the specified requirements.
